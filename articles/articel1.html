      <p>
        Regular exercise helps maintain a healthy weight and lowers the risk
        of several diseases. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise
        most days of the week.

      <h2>Eat Balanced Meals</h2>
      <p>
        Incorporate fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins into
        your diet. Avoid excessive sugar and saturated fats.
      </p>
      <h2>Proper Rest</h2>
      <p>
        Getting enough sleep (7-9 hours) is essential for energy, mood, and
